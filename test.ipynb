We have a distinguished panel of experts with us today who will shed light on the latest developments in AI and its impact on various aspects of our lives. I'll start by introducing our first speaker, Dr. Emily Rodriguez, a renowned AI researcher and professor.\n",
    "Dr. Rodriguez: Thank you, it's a pleasure to be here. Artificial Intelligence has witnessed remarkable growth over the past few decades, and it's now ingrained in our daily lives, from voice assistants in our smartphones to self-driving cars and even in healthcare diagnostics. AI technologies are advancing at an unprecedented rate, driven by deep learning and neural networks. These innovations have allowed machines to perform tasks that were once thought to be exclusive to humans, such as natural language understanding, image recognition, and decision-making. The future of AI holds immense promise, but it also presents important ethical and societal challenges that we need to address.\n",
    "Moderator: Indeed, the ethical aspect of AI is a crucial issue. Let's hear from our next speaker, Dr. James Chen, a pioneer in AI ethics.\n",
    "Dr. Chen: Thank you for having me. As AI technologies continue to advance, it's essential that we consider the ethical implications. AI can perpetuate biases, invade privacy, and disrupt the job market. We must work collectively to ensure that AI is developed and deployed in a way that respects human rights, diversity, and transparency. Regulatory frameworks and ethical guidelines are crucial to navigate this evolving landscape and strike a balance between innovation and safeguarding societal values.\n",
    "Moderator: Excellent points, Dr. Chen. Now, I'd like to turn to Dr. Sarah Patel, who has expertise in AI and its applications in healthcare.\n",
    "Dr. Patel: Thank you. AI in healthcare is revolutionizing how we diagnose, treat, and manage diseases. Machine learning models can analyze vast datasets to predict disease outcomes and personalize treatment plans. It can improve the accuracy of medical imaging and reduce diagnostic errors. However, we must be cautious about data privacy and the need for responsible AI implementation in the healthcare sector. Ensuring data security and patient trust is essential for the successful integration of AI into healthcare systems.\n",
    "Moderator: Thank you, Dr. Patel. Lastly, we have Dr. Michael Johnson, an expert in AI and its economic implications.\n",
    "Dr. Johnson: AI is reshaping industries and economies worldwide. While it has the potential to boost productivity and drive economic growth, it also poses challenges in terms of job displacement and workforce adaptation. The role of governments, businesses, and educational institutions in upskilling and retraining the workforce is paramount. Additionally, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship in AI-related fields can create new opportunities and ensure a balanced and prosperous AI-driven economy.\n",
    "Moderator: Thank you to all our speakers for their valuable insights on the multifaceted world of AI. It's clear that AI's impact on our society is immense, with profound implications across ethics, healthcare, and the economy. As we continue to advance, it is crucial that we remain vigilant and considerate of the ethical and societal dimensions, ensuring that AI remains a force for good.

This session, this panel discussion will run for about an hour and a half and please as before, please pose your questions or comments for the panel through the Q&A function at the bottom of your screens. The session will be moderated by Mr. Michael Veltin, who is a financial services tax partner with Deloitte's Singapore and is the firm's Southeast Asia financial services tax leader. He's also a member of the Asia Voices Working Group and I'm pleased that he is able to moderate the session today. Michael, over to you. Thanks Chris and welcome back everybody and welcome to the panel pointing us for this session. We're looking to do it on the discussion of the speakers prior to the break. Joining us today, we have Panosmic ladies, Panos is Director of Research at the EU Tax Observatory. His research focuses on tax evasion and tax avoidance and he has extensive experience in land level of policymaking in the European Union. We also joined by Bruno Kassala. Bruno is a senior economist at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development's Division of Investment and Enterprise who leads the intellectual property and development unit. Next, and I'm just trying to match my notes to who I see on the screen. Next is Samantha King. Sam, welcome. Sam is the global health tax at Standard Chartered Bank. She's based in London, so good morning, Sam, and leads a team operating across 15 countries, comprising country, functional and process tax specialists. Sam is qualified tax accountant and chartered tax professional. And you know, we'll be bringing a multinational perspective to the implementation issues, which we started to touch on in the previous session. Adding to the multinational sort of viewpoint, we're also joined by Viabub Summby. Viabub is Senior Director of International Taxation at Northern Life Look. Viabub is responsible for worldwide tax planning, managing operational taxes and strategic tax projects across Emea, APAC and Lethams, so kind of very diverse kind of focus in his role. He has over 25 years tax experience in international tax and planning. We also to be joined a little bit into the session by Professor Tabo. Tabo was a professor in the Murk and Tile Law Department at the University of Johannesburg in South Africa and teaches tax law. Prior to being an academic, Tabo, like Sam, was a bank tax person. He was head of tax for Africa for Citibank. He's also the acting tax on bud in South Africa, in the South African office of the tax on bud. So, so introductions done. The way we thought we'd proceed with this segment is that each of the panelists will share their perspective, you know, not just on the issues raised in the paper presentations and Jay's keynote, but you know how the rules impact them, how they see the rules from their perspectives and hopefully with the diversity within the panel, we're going to get a range of perspectives. So each of the speakers will spend, you know, five, eight minutes or so, sort of sharing their viewpoints. And then from there, we'll sort of look to have a discussion around some of the themes that sort of come not just from their comments, but from the earlier papers. And as Chris has mentioned with respect to the previous discussions, you know, please feel free to add your comments, ask questions and take advantage of of the panel we've assembled today for this final session. So with that, I think we'll kick off with with Pannas for his perspectives. And then sort of after that sort of Bruno and we'll kind of continue, we'll continue from there. So Pannas, welcome. Look forward to your views. Thank you, Michael, very much for the introduction. It's a pleasure to be here from an early morning in Paris. And pleasure to join the panel with the distinguished panelists. The perspective that I would like to bring is more the academic and internationalized perspective. And giving you the big picture that comes from data, the academia research and what countries how countries view the upcoming reforms. Firstly, we have seen in the past decades the rise of the multinational company and the multinational company resulted in shifting profits. Zugman and Torsloth in Arisen paper in 2022 have estimated that about 36% of profits of multinational has been shifted and this is an upward trend. Low tax jurisdictions especially attract sizable amounts of profits from these multinationals, other tax at the very, very low rates. The baseline estimates are in the orders of trillions and for a syncopor for example, in the country that the conference today takes place has been estimated to be about 70 billion that has been shifted in 2015 according to the latest estimates. What has explained the rise of the profit shifting that we've seen one is countries. Countries over the past few years have competed in statutory corporate tax rates which have halved since the 80s from 49% to 24 and continuing to be lower with a lot of variation of course some distributions close to zero. And the decline that we have seen is it cannot be compared to other tax rates that exceeds for example in labor. There has not been any similar decline in any other corporate tax rates. In any other tax rates for corporations the decline has been quite remarkable. Why countries do this the computer attract business and capital of courses to stimulate growth. However the literature does not find a strong link between growth and falling tax rates. What do we find instead is a rise of inequality because the equity structure is concentrated heavily at the upper end of the income and wealth distribution. So equity ownership is concentrated and corporate shifting reduces the effective tax on the wealthy. This is what comes from the literature. Low tax destinations essentially facilitate that. So one is countries and I've talked only about statutory tax rates. One goes to effective tax rates. This is even lower because of the numerous schemes that have been introduced. The second is the mode of production that has been going on in different countries over the past few years and facilitating the rise of the multinational, the globalization and digitalization trends. The ways goods have been produced and services have been offered in the past few years. Has dramatically changed especially when we compared them 100 years ago when the old set of rules was decided. How companies are taxed. Production today is mostly spurs. Consumers are located in a number of countries and the companies have become of the past two decades a lot more digital. So it's very easy to be based on one location, have your customers another jurisdictions and of course taxes and policy on taxes. The countries have not responded to that yet because it needs a multinational coordination and only the past few years in the web. So we see the procedure. These rules have been discussed. My point being this, what we will see the new rules is an unavoidable process and is a policy response that has been significantly delayed over the past few years. Let me make a stop here and let others make their points as well. But this is the big picture that comes from academia. Thank you, Thomas. Bruno, you've got a very investment in trade sort of focus. I mean, very interested to kind of get your reactions to Thomas, but also your own perspectives around the impact of pillar two particularly on sort of future investments and trade flows. Sure, Michael, thank you very much for what introduction. Yeah, first of all, I would like to thank Christopher and Institute of Policy Studies Singapore to invite me and it's very interesting discussion. As you are saying, Michael, my background is on investment. So with my vision, what we do is trend and policy studies on on FDI for inviting investment to developing countries. So I think it would be useful to highlight why we think that the international tax reform, same particular, the global minimum tax, it's really important for FDI and for FDI to develop in countries. And it's so important to decide a easier to dedicate a dramatic chapter of our annual world investment report to the implications of the global million tax on FDI. So yeah, in the report, you will find that off discussion and analysis about that, well beyond what I can summarise in my short intervention, but let me try to give you an overview. So the truly I want to answer why it's important, is that it's taxation on FDI. So it's that it's taxation on income generated by FDI, so by the foreign operational potential price. And you know, there has been a lot of controversy on whether tax is always not a driver of investment decisions of multinational price. But if we look at FDI across the last 30 years, both from the data trend and the policy perspective, there is little doubt that taxation has been one of the factors shaping the FDI landscape. If we look just at the last seven years, two editions of the world investment reports as the dramatic chapter international taxation in FDI into 2015 at the beginning of the best process and now in in 2021. So clearly a reform that is going to affect so profoundly and to some extent radically, the taxation of FDI income is expected to have a major major implications on FDI. And it will do so because it will it's expected to transform the way and the needs invest internationally. One way or another and I would like here to highlight three possible ways and then I will list them according to what is my perception of the degree of impact on investment. So the first is the most important I think and perhaps the most of it's going to affect tax competition for attracting FDI investment. And so what really the minimum does is is is really mechanically compressing tax differentiations between countries with ranges of effect tax rate applied by a host country that's because not anymore from 0% to 30% say but now from 15% to 30% and and so in that context what we expect is that taxation will be much less of a driver of investment decision of continuous central prices. And and this is a huge change, massive change and the change at institution like the one I represent by others as well, the MF, the OCD have been advocated for a long, long time. And and and and and now with with with a minimum tax there is a real opportunity to to to realize that at scale. So the the actual potential disruptive potential of the minimum on the on tax competition is still difficult to anticipate because it will also depend on some on some mitigating factors that are actually embedded in the reform. Maybe we have spoken about that before. So first of all the the level of the minimum 15% for some countries this is perceived to be too low to really affect tax competition. Meaning that that MN is already pay more than most of them of the MN is already pay more than 50%. And then and then Pilar 2 is also selective. It does not that's a second factor. It does not affect the same way all the tax incentives. So counter they still have quite a lot of degrees of of freedom in setting incentive in incentive policies to attract FDI. And then there is the third element which is the substance based carve out which basically set up a window that that just capture a share of the income but still where where counties can still apply the tax rate they want. So the window for tax competition. So it would it would depend on several factors overall it's a it's a big change. The second big change is is the in for example, it's shifting. So assuming that that also investment and then profit is reported in offshore financial centers will be subject to a minimum of 50%. So there will be much less of an incentive for good national prices to shift profits from host countries that operation take place to offshore financial centers. And then quite positive on that in the sense that I think that we have 15% minimum. So a 15% minimum is sufficient to this to significantly this incentive and means to shift profits to to offshore financial centers. And and this is this does not just meet general need for furnace in the global tax system by which you need to pay taxes where you generate revenues. But but it's also expected to to to redesign the global FDI network. We know that 30 40% of FDI globally are channel to offshore financial centers. And this channel is large instrumental to profit shifting dynamics of what is the financial price. So to the extent that the minimum is going to significantly decrease profit shifting it will also decrease the amount of investment that are that are channel to this conduit and it will significantly redefine the geography of global FDI. And then we can finally as a last point to the to the third element which is probably the most the most controversial. So to the extent that the global minimum tax is going to affect the cost is going to increase the cost the fiscal cost of investing it will it may have an impact on the total volume of investment. So it may decrease the propensity of of investors to invest. So it may decrease the size of the buy. It doesn't really work as we know like in a shop well you know if the cost of the effort increases I I buy less there are things in taxation like average tax rate, marginal tax rates and it's a marginal that affects the volume of FDI but still still we can it's fair to assume that that that multinational factoring taxation in the investment. So these are the three elements. So the first element is the impact on expectation the second element is the impact on profit shifting and the third element is the impact on cost and volume of FDI. Now if we put together all the all these elements we can understand that it's quite a earthquake in the world of FDI and that's the reason why in our investment report we decided to dedicate the dramatic chapter to this and I stop the at thanks. Thanks Bruno. The Professor Taba still hasn't been off to join yet so so maybe if we could turn next to you for your perspectives and obviously you know bringing with it as you do a multinational kind of lens of opera and one we were operating globally. Thank you Michael and thank you Chris and the panel for inviting me to speak at the event. So my previous two co-panel members have talked sort of quite extensively and probably more erudically than I can on the overall policy objectives of the global minimum tax and why those make sense or not in from an investment perspective. So maybe I will limit myself to two comments on the sort of broader policy. The first is that when I think about the global minimum tax regime I think of it as if you like a huge CFC regime so a controlled foreign company regime but one that in addition to sort of replicating what domestic controlled foreign company regime might do also is able to handle inversions. So inversions in this context being when a group moves its top company to typically a lower tax location to avoid CFC regime. So for me that's what the global minimum tax sort of achieves as a policy tool for for countries. If I then look at that for a globally regulated banking group an inversion changes the lead regulator of your group or impacts the choice of the lead regulator. So there are really multiple commercial regulatory considerations which already effectively control whether a global banking group would indeed invert. So so looking at from an industry perspective global minimum tax is a very large hammer to use a very large hammer to crack a knot but may or may not exist. That said I can see that that doesn't apply outside of globally regulated organizations. Second comment from a policy perspective is really whether there is the opportunity to link two major global initiatives. So we have the global minimum tax regime. We also have the journey to net zero and I do wonder whether there's an opportunity to link those and to effectively allow incentives that drive us towards net zero from a climate perspective to allow those incentives in the global minimum tax regime. I think not likely to happen anytime soon because I think an early policy choice in global minimum tax was actually to avoid sectoral incentives and it's quite hard to to design a regime design to take on the journey to net zero without having some elements of sectoral views. But I do wonder if we look over a longer time horizon whether those two policy tools could effectively be brought together to therefore maybe create a more positive purpose of a global minimum tax than the perhaps slightly negative perception it comes with today. So those are two comments on the policy aspects maybe now go on to what Michael asked me more directly to talk about. So if we take the policy objective of flooring corporate tax competition between states as a given and then look at how proportionate the execution is. So in any legislation guidance etc you have a tradeoff between simplicity and therefore the amount of compliance costs and complexity or in effect the accuracy with which the legislation implements the policy objectives. When I look at what I think good sort of policy implementation involves it involves having legislation that accurately represents the policy objective and then trading off that complexity through things like safe harbor tests. One observation I have about the global minimum tax regime is that some of that complexity has been traded off in the legislation itself and I think that that will cause problems as we start to implement that this over the coming years. So what what what I kind of my bright lines on that well I guess one point is a regime that is designed to ensure we pay a minimum of a globally a minimum tax of 15% is paid should not exacerbate double tax. It should erode double non taxation but it shouldn't exacerbate double tax and I think there are a number of items within the regime where that tradeoff has been made to say we'll go for something simpler whether on the trans-surprising rules or on how losses are treated but in a way that will definitely create double tax in certain commercial considerations. Second point really is around around how a regime handles stress. So it's important that you accurately achieve your policy objectives when organizations are making profits. It's even more important that you achieve them when organizations are under stress. You do not want to exacerbate a financial stress by charging someone tax at the point additional tax at the point that they're in the middle of a financial stress because that has much broader potential so potential regulation and also economic consequences for bankruptcies etc. The way the rules at the moment work on losses and I am confident that the OECD will fix this but the way they work at the moment on losses effectively if you hold government bonds which is a requirement for a banking group we're required to hold high quality liquid assets. If you hold exempt government bonds and you suffer a period of financial stress the legislation wants you to pay tax on the impact of those government bonds which you won't have had any benefit from because you've just made a huge loss but it wants you to pay tax on the future benefit that you might get from the loss related to exempt bonds today. So that is a very poor piece of sort of matchup between the policy objectives of the global tax regime and the policy objectives of global regulators and potential policy. I think that if you sort of play that forward I think that's an area where for me the consultative process hasn't worked as well as it could. So when you have legislation of the complexity we have here implemented domestically there's generally a very close engagement between the regulators and the tax policy makers to make sure those things are balanced and I think that's an area where voices from Asia from the rest of the world could have been more effective in influencing the policies that we've got. Final comment on the implementation. The other sort of area that concerns me about how the rules are currently implemented is the volatility of them. So whenever you trade off simplicity and complexity you really need to scenario test it for a different set for the economic results that you might pump through. Again this is particularly relevant for the banking industry but I think it applies more broadly. The relevance of the banking industry is that our accounting rules tend to mean that when there is a macro economic stress whether that's COVID whether that's global political outcomes of the Ukraine-Russia situation, when there's a macro economic stress stress the way the accounting rules work for a bank is it tends to make you make a loss and then in subsequent periods you may make a profit so in effect your the present value of all of the future economic events are present valued and put through your books in the current period. What that means is that your financial outcomes tend to be quite volatile period on period and therefore the fact that as currently written the carry-back carry forward rules don't work brilliantly is a significant concern. So I think maybe if I if I therefore summarize on that point I would like to see a better trade off between complexity and simplicity I would like the rules to actually achieve a policy objective and then trade off the complexity with a safe harbor set of rules and I'm not sure that's where I think that is better policy design and I'm not sure that's holy where we are today. Thank you Michael. Thanks Sam. Last but not least, we'll vibe up your perspectives. Right so thanks very honored to be on the panel and leave it on you guys so thank you for this opportunity. I vote for Norton which is not called a gen which provides software and technology solutions to our users so that they can live their digital lives in a safe and secured manner. It's it's a US MNC we operate in the number of countries and with that comes the issue of how do we manage these changing regulations country by country at a global OECD level and from an internal tax department perspective how can we bring value to the business how can we update our management and our board as to what is the potential impact of these new changes of these new taxes is a going to increase our effective tax rate by one or by two percentage points is it going to bring more complexity whether it's going to lead to double taxation so I think what what we prefer is kind of a consistent approach in the rules and its implementation and I can I can tell you technology software companies are changing their business models all the time we have to adopt and adapt our offerings and technology solutions to you know to to changing requirements from the clients from an innovation perspective so how can we from a global tax department perspective bring about certainty in planning in forecasting and how can we bring strategic oversight second point is in terms of the US regulations now clearly we have heard over the last few hours on this on this session that the US regulations are not in sync with what the pillar to model rules look like prime examples are the common alternate minimum tax which got introduced just in August under the inflation reduction act which also is at 15 percent but it is not a pillar to tax so how do you make that in sync with the pillar to rules the second aspect of it is with respect to the foreign tax credit regulations in the US that's very important for us to see whether the foreign taxes that we are incurring do we have the ability to claim credits or not with these kind of rules and different the option of it in different countries do we have the ability to claim a credit for these taxes and that boils to the point of is this going to result in in double taxation there could be a lot of friction between the OECD model rules as well as the domestic top-up regimes as to how they could be implemented so we do anticipate and foresee a lot of tax disputes and the unintended consequence of this could be having double taxation you know getting taxed in the source country not getting credit back so that's something to kind of look into I will now get into the computational aspect of pillar to unlike many current tax systems the pillar to minimum tax is going to be determined based on book income so you have your pre-tax results and then you have a lot of adjustments you're not too to compute what your effective income under the global should look like there could be a lot of adjustments right they could be trans-surprising adjustments they could be IP transfers that will need to get adjusted out you know many other operational accounting adjustments that will happen so our companies set out to do such complex calculations it will require new processes it will require some controls some systems some education internally you know between our finance accounting groups and the tax groups so so a lot of computational aspects and to that point also our ERP systems you know they are not designed to throughout such calculations in a very quick and a very nimble manner so that will require a lot of data challenges accounting kind of massaging around that numbers and and that's where I foresee a lot of work or additional resources will be required to to to to to get this done my next point could be how are these domestic top-up taxes going to be administered now that's a pretty challenging question that that that that we're going to get into because we talk about top-up tax as if it was a very universal single-level calculation but it's going to be administered in many different manners and and that's what is going to create the complexity is it countries which are going to implement minimum taxes to apply to their own domestic taxable income so they can collect and administer the taxes through the QDMTT what if you know there is no QDMTT and under the model rules say it's probably US had quarter company you can you can address it through the income inclusion rules and if if you don't have the model rules you don't have a QDMTT then you go into the very the very complex under-tax payment rules I'm not going to get into the depth of it but just just talking about it just thinking about practically throws up a lot of challenges for taxpayers or internal tax departments and and a lot of work to be done so if if I were to just kind of summarize what what one of the main challenges we want to ensure that we don't get into a double taxation scenario because it is it is looking more and more like it seems like a double tax you know the credibility the credibility of the foreign top-up taxes which have paid under the domestic top-up regime second point could be on the dispute resolution framework are we going to have a mandatory mechanism which will which will help us much more than what mutual agreement procedure would do for us currently thirdly on the compliance process you know that seems pretty complex you know to to manage this data transformation systems processes again a challenge for companies and hopefully this new international framework does not hinder economic growth that that I'm sure governments tax administrators would not want to see simply because we are in a very uncertain economic environment do we think we are in a recession maybe not do we think we'll be in a recession next year probably so so do we want companies to to grow investments to create employment opportunities and and to set up their regional base the regional headquarters you know the global hubs that that we are positioned in Singapore so so those are my kind of collection of thoughts from a very industry level sorry to throw up more challenges than than solutions no problems at all thank you by Bob as as the panelists have been talking you know there's been a bunch of questions come in in addition to the questions that I think you know Chris and I had sort of each had but maybe to start with take them in order in which they've come and there was one from the floor and panos and bruna you might be able to see this in the q&a box but for dr panos dr bruna thank you for showing your insights the need for beps to update the international tax rules to cope with globalization digitization and the resultant behavior of global amenities as well articulated however with the tide of globalization and free flow of fdi capital challenged with decoupling more nationalistic policies from Frenchoring to subsidy of chips and how do you see the beps say so beps as aims of harmonizing international rules interact with with those forces of fragmentation yeah thanks a lot for that question yeah it's very very interesting and a very good question I think what the what the pillar to is trying to do in all this is trying to put a floor in where the tax competition is going and if you don't put the floor then the floor would essentially go down to zero and I doubt that zero taxes help in helping the different sectors and providing the support that they need what happens is that essentially the revenues for governments go down to zero and then they they cannot give enough subsidies they have to tax other sectors of the economy is what we see at the macro level so the taxes come from consumption the taxes come from labor and of course there's a counter argument that this hinders growth as well inequality as well is one of the factors that hinders growth the governments can support the different sectors through other policies for example they can provide subsidies to particular policies I've heard the argument also about linking the global minimum tax with the net zero aim as was voiced by Samantha I think this can be done through additional tax serving you and through financing investment to specific sectors this what the government policy has done for many many many years so giving policies to specific sectors helps more than not putting a limit to the raise to the bottom this how are you the situation and how it could work better maybe I should give the floor to Bruno if he wants to comment as well yes just just a quick comment it's a very very interesting interesting question I would say that this discussion we we have already touched what are for me the three main teams in FDI looking forward so one is the global minimum tax the other one is what Samantha was referring to the green transition sustainable FDI and and the other one is what the question refers to the the restructuring of global value chains and this this push that we see it's objectively like that towards more local value chains or more national policies so of inward tendency from countries to to to to to retreat from from globalization now so my first reaction to the question is this when retreat from globalization comes first from sort of skepticism on the capacity of multilateralism to deliver and the global minimum tax is a good example with with all the limits that that he has and all the doubts that we can have about implementation is a good example in the opposite direction so a big number of countries they excited to a big step towards towards tax cooperation so a big number of countries excited to sell a limit on on on on the fact it's tax where they can apply so in some sense to limit the tax of gravity in favor of a better more coordinated international tax system so this is the the the the most I think powerful and answers we could we could make to to to to this tendency so what's uh sort of retreating from from globalism multilateralism and so on and of course there are there are challenges because it's true the TFDI are under pressure already especially what we call efficiency seeking FDI so the TFDI are very very important to make nature for example so adding the further challenges on in terms of taxation can be can be can be can be very challenging but I agree with panellitis the answer is not to live in place a system that doesn't work but the the the the answer is to set up an effective multilateral process to take care of of the system and and so far I would say that with all the limbs and the challenges the process has has been able to deliver a policy answer to the to the big challenges that are that are that we are facing thank you both as you've both been answering that question we've been we've been joined by professor tabo so maybe we just pause on the q and a for a moment and and go back to professor tabo and tabo if you don't mind sharing your perspectives on the topic and and I know from our kind of earlier conversations you you're sort of you know what's the focus of the seminar is Asia but I think it is actually very interesting to understand you know reactions in Africa particularly also given the wide use of incentives in Africa and how sort of you know governments and how you know corporate and multinationals are responding to to this development in your region so please over to you thank you very much Michael and good morning good afternoon good evening whichever applies to everybody over here I am really very sorry that I couldn't join earlier and this will talk a little bit to our resource issues in in the African continents we've got a systemic power cuts that we refer to conveniently as load shading they just purely blackouts where government fails to suppliers with enough power so you don't get to know in advance whether you're going to be affected or not so just as I thought I was going to to join the call I realized that I would not have power where I was so I had to drive to a different location in order to make sure that I've got power so that goes to that goes to what it goes to the challenges that a lot of African countries face where you've got systems but systems don't work and when systems don't work you fail to deliver on what you promise to do now when it comes for example how do I link this to global minimum tax and and and the global rules inclusive framework and and I would go back to beps on its own the point is that there is quite a lot that we have as all countries it's not only developing countries but all countries have a lot on their plates in relation to tax that needs to be dealt with now you'll find that developing countries have their tech systems which tends to be complex because they need to keep up with the global trends and then we we we enact a lot of anti-avoidance rules we enact a lot of provisions that we as countries become unable to administer and when they become unable to administer the concern that comes with that is why would we be bringing up more and more complexity more and more rules in the systems when we are unable to administer the current ones would we be able to keep up with that I'll take you back to base erosion and profit shifting with base erosion and profit shifting some countries like South Africa went at great lengths to try to incorporate the rules that are the global rules and to be honest with you some of these rules are yet to be understood some of the rules are yet to be implemented because purely of resource availability there is not enough resources in the text administrators offices in the text authorities to administer some of these and to understand implement an administer it's it's a big problem now the other issue that we find is is that as a result the the benefits of the inclusive framework and I will be particular to the global minimum text for example just using it as an example African countries have gone at great lengths to understand what the actual impact of those rules are for us as African countries and developing countries in general so for example we look at the the logic behind the logic behind them is that if you using global minimum text as an example again if you are to implement a rule like that the benefit of it are said to be that you will get more revenue you will get more text revenue and that developing countries benefit more but you know when you look at it deeper deeper and deeper and a lot of information has been shared in terms of which we know that the US would be the biggest beneficiary of global minimum text for example and that with African countries it's so negligible that nobody even knows the numbers or somebody some people would hazard some numbers that seem like a little bit of some some suck but but there are those numbers and some of the benefits are that we would be curbing the race to the bottom wonderful idea but then the question is if we are curbing race to the bottom how are we doing that we're doing that because in a way that we keep in the Texas high we're not using Texas as a competing or as a tool to compete but African countries always ask the question what else do we have to use as a competition tool what everything else that is day the key determinants of business political stability security you know the the currency powers etc etc we don't we simply don't have it and that is effect so if we are to compete with with developed countries and we're taking our way our own and the only available tool for competition in order to get into the the the the boxing ring with persons that have more other abilities who have more other facilities to compete when we deprive ourselves of the only one that we have think about it this way we we use Texas and I'm not going to lie about that incentives are prevalent as Michael said in Africa we use incentives to attract investment because we don't have any other strong mode of competition and if we take that away the question is what are we left with well you we talk about race to the bottom and we say well we at the bottom in most respects um you know we and we do not find that we tend to lose a lot if we engage in that so this this is just some of the things that we need to think about and maybe just at one last third point one last third point is is that shouldn't we as African countries and as developing countries look at once as i've talked talked about strengthening our available resources like our available Texas and uh uh uh text it implements but then also maybe let us make sure that we exhaust those properly um let us make sure that we exhaust those properly and develop um products text products that would fit our countries so in in this regard when African countries one of the African countries that blatantly refused to adopt uh for example um pillar two is Kenya and Kenya is basically saying if we are looking at digital services as a problem then perhaps we need a tax or a system that is specific to our problem and deal with it and that is why they have introduced a digital services tax that applies to digital services at a low rate of below a percent um uh of of the the um the total amount of the turnover and um and that is how it is applied and they believe Kenya strongly believes that that works best and it is administrable locally etc in addition to that you look at in in our competition space most African countries have withholding taxes withholding taxes that are a very strong backstop of tax incentives and low tax rates they apply and they make it such that uh in as a general matter we would have at least um i mean like looking at our effective windows the digital tax rates averaging about 30 percent um the application of the withholding taxes should when properly administered bring our effective tax rates to about 16 17 or 18 percent um i think i will post right day last i hog the stage thank you professor to have a actually it's interesting that the the points that you made were dealt with in matte andru's paper and and matt was kind of making the point that sort of you know glow you know pillar two is very sort of economic efficiency is the dominant sort of criteria driving that um and he was arguing that it really doesn't deal with or address vertical equity and i think the example you you said what us do we have that we don't have tax incentives um you know in terms of competing in terms of infrastructure and education my apologies i'm just reading from my hand for it'll notes um but but matt's paper argues that um there should be a he proposes a framework for uh qualified developing country incentive regime um i was just sort of you know i mean and one of the questions I do want to ask and i think it's just kind of timely given professor type as professor type as comments i mean what was the reaction from the panel to that um you know maybe you know for the type of sort of starting with you just as a follow-on to your comments but but um you know unass Bruno and obviously others to the extent that they wanted to comment on that as well and and Sam just for your reference here in the in the subsequent q&a you know matt made this comment that it might be a bit too late for that but then sort of said well maybe it's going to be relevant for things like you know green incentives and sort of getting in the line sort of getting in the alignment in terms of you know sort of priorities but um i'll turn to panelist did you want to comment first and then sort of Bruno and after professor type as if you wanted to kind of comment on that proposal and how you would see that that that would be perhaps a good starting point yeah fantastic I mean like as I have said um i would really say that when you have targeted particular um rules that are intended to curb certain kinds of avoidance that are applicable in the countries you achieve more than when you adopt a policy or a principle that is intended for countries that do not have the same problems as you do like for example as I say you have African countries that still struggle to administer principles that way um adopted by everybody long time ago you know when you think about transfer pricing it's still one of those difficult things to administer in the countries so maybe it's more like a targeted solution than adopting a globalized form um in respect of um specific challenges per country thank you thank you so maybe you think I can go next uh yeah please please please too um so I don't know the proposal exactly um but uh what I can say is that uh we have done a lot of research on the expected benefits especially in European countries but also on some other countries that we have data um in order to get the the expected revenue that they will have uh we carry a lot about the effect of the policies on developing countries and Africa especially and that's why in the next few years we will be expanding also our research to the effect on developing countries uh these these are not uh European or they shouldn't be European only US policies western uh policies they have a global impact and so we do want to investigate going forward the impact that they will have on different countries and different regions um for the EU uh if I can give some data we are estimating uh some some gains of around 80 uh billion and some of this and without the car votes with the car votes this uh maybe water down a little bit uh and the go closer to 64 billion uh at least the effects of uh pillar uh two um some of these benefits uh go to uh countries of Eastern Europe that have um a significant activity there some of the other benefits go to countries um that have headquarters uh uh of companies um and um uh in a way we should think of a fair share uh going to different countries uh based on the activity that depends on different countries um for uh uh we have also some estimates on the impact of um um Asian countries for example sinkable would be one of the biggest gainers from the reforms close to 24 billion we are estimating uh just because it has uh different estimates uh and uh it has um um multinationals based there are certain borders but this goes to show how the reforms would impact uh the revenues of countries because with the increase uh countries would uh be able to collect and uh even African countries if they have some activity then they wouldn't collect it at zero that are very very low rates but they would be able to compete not at uh closer to the zero level but closer to the 15 level at least so uh we we see that uh there is uh extra revenue that would be coming in the countries uh of course electric research that we'll be doing uh we'll be aiming to uh uh examine the allocation all over the globe uh but uh this is what i can say for now. uh Michael? oh yes thank you yes Bernadette would you like to comment? just quickly react to um uh the the intervention of professor tabo he raised a few points they are all uh uh very very important um i i just want to to uh to to come back on one because it is the one that i hear more when i i i'm discussing uh pillar to developing countries and it's it's it's it's to my from my perspective from investment perspective it's really the most important so uh the point is if we don't have tax incentive what does do we have right um and uh and this is this is this is really key i think um well first of all um i i i'm not denying this uh it's uh i think it's again it's the most important maybe uh just couple of considerations that that would deserve a bit in perspective so one uh is for example that many African countries um provides incentive on on on on investments for not wear resources for example right so on something that they have as something unique so there may be a little bit too much of uh name phrases or an overstatement of tax incentives as a as a as a as a tool to attract investment i think this this this is a sort of a matter of fact second element often this tax geography matters so often this tax or not always but often this tax competition for attracting investment is a competition within Africa so it's competition with your with your neighbor um there there is also a part of competition with Asia and Latin America much less i would say with developed economies but i mean so so you know talking about uh tax competition from an African perspective um is it's tricky because because it's like like tax competition in you is often between you uh European countries so so that's just to to to to to consideration um to put this this this argument in a bit of perspective but overall i think it's a very important argument but i think that it should be seen as a challenger not on on the on the fundamental idea of the minimum tax but as a challenge on how to support uh developing countries in the next five years you know to to to um realize this transition to this new narrative and this new way to attract investment you don't build uh uh a very alternative value position to tax in a four-night then you don't build that alternative assets if you don't have them i see what professor table was saying to attract investment in a four-night um so so we really need and i think that that institutions like like like like uan uan uan than like like i was cd i have very very important responsibility that we really need to sideline with with the developing countries to support them in the next five years because those will be really really uh challenging for all the reason that professor table was was mentioned professor taboany reactions to yes thank you very much Michael and and thanks uh panellotid for your pledge to do research um to to see what benefits there could be for for African countries and just back to bruner's point you know we've said this before that when when people look at Africa they see Africa as if Africa is one country unfortunately there is um there is real competition within African countries the frustrating part and we've had this at the south african development corporation level sadek where we we we try to encourage African countries to not indulge in incentives especially where we would be competing against that with each other and only with each other and nobody else because of that wealth in resources it's a big problem it is something that is undesirable because you know we go back to what panellotid says that you're you're collecting zero when in actual fact you couldn't collect anything well you know you could collect 15 you could collect 10 but you collect 10 because you've got that ability that you're not utilizing so there is a drive to to realize that when you've got resources you need to utilize them very well but there is a lot of desperation that gains says that desperation that makes countries fail to properly acknowledge and analyze the ability that they that the countries have so I would be very interested uh panellotid in finding um a balance between what we could collect and keeping on being able to attract investment because there is a lot that is stacked against African and other developing countries and I would tell you Asian African countries must be having the same challenges but the point is not to push this to African countries or developing countries without being conscious of the challenges that they face so you want to be conscious of those challenges you want to be able to work around those challenges and provide a solution that is holistic that is all encompassing to these countries why it's the same time and as I as I've said before we are waking money from the African text administrators forum to say yes it's a good thing to admit to adopt but there is also challenges within the countries where like you know like countries like Senegal almost already almost immediately adopted without analysis because it seemed like a good um I think to do without looking at the the the challenges that you would bring but yeah I take the points and I think that those points need to be repeated through a lot of our countries both African and Asian in order to conscientize everybody to say a good system if well adopted might benefit all of us makes sense thank you all um but just um we are linking back to some of the earlier presentations I mean um there was a focus um Melissa and the advanced sort of focused on impact on facts on tax incentives and designing incentives and policy responses you know Bruno you talked about you know Globe is going to have a big impact on on FDI but yeah just sort of perhaps you know again opening it to the floor but um you know how should and draw your distinction between developing Asia versus developed Asia yeah how should developing Asia think about you know attracting FDI on a go forward basis how should they think about sort of you know incentives and I think Bruno you were sort of alluding to you know there is going to be a process but I'm just sort of you know where maybe to start with you wanted to sort of expand a little bit on you really comments um and then sort of get reactions from the others sort of the same no sorry I was just going to ask could could we make I think that I'd possibly both had a comment on developing oh sure yes yes yeah yeah yeah no no no please go ahead you yes here the here the point yeah I guess from an issue perspective it is a a media of countries right we have like 48 countries in the region and uh you know OECD cannot legislate or implement the laws so their goal is to have a general consensus and among the broader inclusive framework and then let the country by country implement the laws and treaties so Asia being so diverse full of emerging economies requires different sets of social and economic policies right so that they can achieve their goals and uh one of the things that I guess you know professor Chris has mentioned in his Asia voices tapered is that many countries in Asia do not converse in English language or in the French language so how do they interpret the official statements you know the model rules and and treaties so it could be a challenge I guess just to echo I guess professor Thabo's point is there is challenging part for the tax administrators to have systems in place you know to make sure the necessary interpretations are made and also to have professionals who could understand explain and implement such concepts you know either by modifying the tax rules or by overlaying on the on the existing domestic rules right so uh and also the capacity in Asia is still developing you know they are still getting up in terms with transfer pricing uh not to forget India uh just had a universal VAT regime just five years ago right like a universal VAT regime so they are still developing they are still trying to get sophisticated so I guess the whole point being that one size does not fit all uh that's what professor Thabo is trying to make a point don't yeah no try to point send um so maybe to pick up on on a similar a similar theme so from my perspective the global minimum tax regime is not really a tax raising regime it's fundamentally an anti-avoidance provision but it's an anti-avoidance provision over governments rather than over tax payers so I think in the end the people the the countries that will raise tax as a global minimum tax are those who currently have low taxes and I think in fact that's probably if if we look at the numbers somebody um with a lot more evidence-based uh data I think made the points earlier in the discussion um so when I then think about the practicality of a regime for developing countries I sort of think of two points about whether the global minimum taxes is is the area to spend the effort on on that um because as I said I don't think there's going to be a huge amount of tax actually raised if we look five to ten years down the line I think individual countries will have adjusted their policy to pick up the tax domestically so so I think of two points that the first is whenever you come to try to define a developing country um it always has a lot of different uh debate points to it and I think you have to think about the policy objective of global minimum tax in part was to stop inversions and a lot of inversions have happened to in particular Caribbean uh headquarters locations so you've got to think a little bit broader globally to the design something that will deliver the objectives you're talking about but I think the second point is if I could change one thing to make global tax work better for a developing country it would probably be around the chance for pricing rules and how chance for pricing rules deal with the distribution of expenses as we look at sort of a more global infrastructure supply chain we have just more centralized supply chains wherever they are centralized they are more centralized than they used to be and therefore you have more cost to be distributed and at the moment trans-surprising does not really take account of the purchasing economic purchasing power of a country in deciding how to distribute expenses and I think if if if some work could be done on trans-surprising to maybe tweak that that feels to me like it would deliver a bigger bang for the buck for developing countries than will come through global minimum tax and therefore possibly is an area more worthy of the efforts of the panelists and the prime panelists to Michael that was a positive thank you for the way to pause us and take us backwards which I know as a moderator is extremely annoying when people do that but I have to look more closely at the chat box as I'm going along as opposed to being engrossed in your conversations I've been very angry in terms of developing Asia and just kind of closing up this part of the discussion but also going back to your comments you know the impact on FDI how do you see that sort of you know how do you see that impact and also how should particularly not just developing countries in Asia but developing countries generally think about this and coming back to the broader theme in terms of voice of Asia, voice from the ground how was an African region should people be thinking about this relevant stakeholders be thinking about this? Yeah so I will maybe first mention how I see the general picture and then maybe I will try to talk a little bit about developing Asia so relative to what for example Samantha was just saying about but you know the challenges and what could have been done differently or better in terms of the tax design of the reform? I have an investment perspective right so one thing is from the perspective of investment and of countries especially developing countries receiving the investment as one important component of the economic development strategy so from that perspective the way we see epirat 2 is as a powerful excuse and let's believe this way excuse to do things that should have been done for quite a long time and to do them quickly no among these primarily the review of investment in scientists so in that sense it's a mainly as an opportunity but we should also recognize that it's a huge step especially from again from the investment perspective especially for developing countries and as I was saying before the transition phase while they are you know they from here to a steady state where they will have revised their mechanism and the available positions of such investment will be very challenging and very dangerous especially if this happens in a sort of uncoordinated and patchy way with some country you know racing forward some country stepping behind so in order to coordinate this phase is I think it's really important that the multilateral processes work well work well so we have done a step which is setting up a sort of agreed largely agreed tax reform with a principle that I think it's also largely agreed by the shareholders sorry by the stakeholders but now there is a really critical phase I think for developing Asia for example to add or for example to Africa right so generally speaking from a counter perspective the objective is when talking about FDI is to upgrade in what we call the global value change many Asian countries have done this brilliantly others they need to do that other than into that what what do we mean by upgrading the global value change you know moving from activities basically in the global value change global you added to activities higher value added so this is this is where many developing countries in developing Asia stand and this is their objective is the introduction of a global minimum tax you know problematic for that objective I don't see as one of the most problematic things it will be further pressure it will put further pressure on FDI it will be as quiz further efficiency seeking FDI because the FDI will cost more but I honestly don't see taxation and this is a difference with for example Africa and Latin American Caribbean as a critical elements in the strategy of developing countries in developing Asia towards FDI it's true that it's efficient seeking FDI so it's the I would have the objective of of minimizing costs but that has as generally come in the case of developing Asia with with leveraging labor costs rather than rather than than taxes so in that sense in that sense those those those those arguments around nationalism reshoring the relocation regionally these are much more problematic for for for for for for developing Asia I didn't say rather than than than the global minimum tax which is any case a big thing but but but no I don't see as hugely problematic for developing Asia I don't have any quick kind of final observations on on this point because I do want to sort of shift to to multinational kind of perspective shortly so but any final comments on on this topic or response to Bruno I certainly agree with what has been said maybe the comment that I want to make about developing Asia and the Asian region in general is that we don't know a lot yet about the implications that we will have and we need to increase research in the area maybe this is something this conference might be a start as well out of out of our data we we do have some estimates for Asian countries but not for all the countries who we bait our estimates using CBCR data which come from the OECD country by country ordering data of the macro level as well but as these become more available in the next few years for example Australia has lately voted in making this available and the European Union at least for companies that are operating either at corners or CBCR is in the EU they will have to make this available from 2024 so we will be able to estimate better what the revenue effect at least will be for each of the countries in terms of competition we know that it's a very dynamic area of course it's not only the tax competition that matters the most of the Asian countries have invested a lot in capital and labor and also on the regulatory framework which is helping companies invest there so it's not only tax incentives that matter for their choices I think this is the general comment that I have for the area and yeah have several points but for other other issues and maybe it will contact one later thank you panel top of any final oh yes I just wanted to touch on that very important very important points that Samantha and Bruno raised as well as Ponyot because you know my take is that we tend to like new products new new techs provisions and before we even implement them properly we bring about new ones without even going back to say how well have these operated like a lot of countries would have introduced transfer price and legislation CFC legislation they is country by country reporting that we just spoke about now fatka beps action please we've got all of these but it for me it's like we don't assess them adequately to see if they work and nobody can say back to Samantha's point nobody can say that or I don't know if anybody can say that we have been able to use all and any techs provisions be them anti-avoidance or texting provisions in the country sufficiently to say that they don't work and therefore we need new products in most instances there are leaks there are things that go I'm not as there are administrative inefficiencies and then when we before we even go and fix those administrative inefficiencies we come up with new products I am not against minimum text or at all I am basically saying let's fresh out everything that we have sufficiently to make sure that it doesn't work and therefore we require a minimum text considering that our problems are not the same yeah I'll post it thank you thank you all for the for the discussion a large part of the audience is actually kind of representing multinationals or also multinational advisors and I think if I've been your introductory comments you talked a little bit about your process in terms of engaging the stakeholders and thinking about implementation and I know you touched on it a little bit but maybe at the starting point if you wanted to you know a little bit about you know more about sort of you know for a global bank you know how are you thinking about this and one of the themes through the earlier presentations was really you know the complexity the implementation challenges in practice etc and energy doing that you're early a comment sort of elicited a question from a I think a fellow bank tax professional it's in the Q&A box I'm happy to read it out but you know it's in this amount of thank you for showing your views on the upcoming rules but I asked that you share some further details on the particular aspect of the rules which give rise to financial services challenges mentioned each either one point and if there are obvious ways to address this in the context of the draw framework so maybe Sam if you could talk generally about you know implementation approach for you know such as for a global bank and I mentioned before Tabo arrived that he also had a bank tax background with with city bank in Africa but then if you could sort of touch on on Aaron's specific questions as well I think that would be great and and sort of above maybe after that if there's other points you wanted to make you know from a multinational perspective from somebody who's going to have to implement this you know across multi regions I think that would be you know for a very helpful to broaden out that conversation Sam over to you. Thank you Michael and so maybe to take the the banking question first and so the detail of the rule that that causes the issue is that banks are required to hold government bonds in order to ensure sort of liquidity resilience so it's a part of the regular true regime a lot of government bonds in many countries are non-taxable that's not really to do with the tax treatment of corporates it's more because if you look at typical investor in a in a in a government bond it's typically a flow through fund or it say excuse me a sovereign fund or or or a pension fund so particularly pension funds so they're often non-taxable just for the efficiency of the tax system what you end up with how it how the global rule's word draft when you make an accounting loss what the global rules try to do is to tax you on the credit effectively the benefit they think you're getting from the credit from the non-taxable government bonds in the period of the accounting loss this is simple because it then means you don't have to track the usage of that loss forward to find out when you did actually use it but obviously if you've just made a huge accounting loss during the middle of a financial stress to be taxed on a credit for a government bond exemption that you can't use because you have huge losses and you may indeed never be able to use is not really the right point in time to be levy in that tax there are two ways of fixing it the first is you could just make government non-taxable government bonds a good permanent difference for for the global rules I don't think you'll find many people investing in government bonds as a sort of part of an investment strategy that doesn't make doesn't require that they are not the most exciting investment products that you can because it can find so I think that would work I think more likely what will happen is that the the the loss rules will be fixed more generally in the framework because I think there were quite a lot of other issues with how the loss rules worked so I'm really expecting that to get fixed in those and so that was the I guess the more detailed question which I hope Aaron answered answers the question if I move on to more general implementation challenges I am lucky enough to have just invested in a global tax reporting software for doing my book I have for a book reporting and that really I think is going to prove a very lucky I'd love to say foresight investment decision by the tax department but I suspect it was a little bit of luck but what that means is that we do have most of the data that we need in order to fly over the global minimum tax regime and we have it in a central repository I think for those that don't currently the compliance cost of this regime are I'm going to be a lot more significant so leaving that to one side what what drives the compliance cost I think the thing that is most going to drive the compliance cost or the lower level or that compliance cost being a lower amount is really the standardisation of the individual domestic qualified regimes if the OECD keeps a firm line on that and if country is implement domestic qualified regimes that actually mirror the globe regimes that will keep the compliance costs to a proportional amount to implement legislation if we start getting variations on a theme there the compliance costs just double triple quadruple the second thing that drives compliance costs is not having the rules in the sufficiently in advance of the legislation actually going live which then means that you have to build a transitional solution in order to go live as well as a strategic solution to do it properly you pretty much double the costs or more of any implementation and that is exponentially goes up the closer the time goes to the legislation going live and you not having all of the guidance so the fact that we don't yet as we speak have the safe harbor rules is really a fundamental driver of compliance costs so I think those are the two things that can be done to kind of be and create a proportionate compliance cost outcome but I do appreciate that I'm speaking from a slightly fortuitous position in just having rolled out some some global software on reporting so I guess my that would be my my my observation and maybe we'll see how how aligned or not that is with expected again no I think I think that's that's very good sound that you've been able to implement it and companies like us and in the industry are still trying to figure out you know what's what's the best course in terms of reporting data, compliance is and internal resources right to make sure we are able to pull together all the requirements that that come about from these new rules so we push out of each out to you later on I guess the two couple of points that I'd like to make and I'll keep it brief I guess coming up on time yeah is on Singapore and the Singapore tax incentives because the government agencies in Singapore EDD has emphasized their need for the continuing need of tax incentives in Singapore and and you know how does that impact the companies that are already in one because there is a need for having quantitative and qualitative investment requirements you know innovation certain level of seniority of decision making and flow easier so now that we'll have a domestic minimum top of tax how does that gel with you know the other business costs and investments that we need to make so that's the cost-benefit analysis that you know many companies in the industry will need to undertake and to that point I guess we heard that during this seminar that some of the data that came out from the research that Mona and the tax observatory had that Singapore is doing the standard benefit to the extent of $78 billion for euros and what does it do with this what does it do with this additional revenue that it did not have before versus the continuing need for investments you know the global trading hub the global investment hub, mounting hubs shipping hubs you know so how does that work from an economic policy perspective so those are some of the points that that that keep us thinking Michael you're muted. You think after three years of COVID I get used to the mute button I was going to say any reactions from our policy friends in terms of the compliance aspect and the compliance costs just listening to that multinational sort of enhanced perspective of having to take this and implement it globally. I just have maybe two quick comments the first on the estimation of the gains for Singapore that is at 22 billion yeah then I didn't say around 70 just to be clear but there's still quite significance around 5.5% of Singapore's GDP so it's quite a big big amount of money that we expect Singapore to collect and we will be updating also our estimates in the next few months as the new macro level CBR data have been released from the OECD but I also wanted to do a comment on the banks because systemic banks in Europe is an area that we have focused on given that they are required to publish their country by country micro country by country reporting data so we know most of their activities in in different countries and my colleagues here have have produced reports on on banks what we see in regards to banks is that not all will be affected the ones that will be affected are those that do most of the profit shifting so they have different models a business models that they operate a commercial bank which is quite large and systemic is very different from a just BC for example and also other other banks have different models that are quite more global than domestic we have produced reports based on what the countries release as CBR and we have also made the similar estimations of how they would be impacted and how much they will have to they will have to pay and this depends very much on how much they use low tax destinations so indeed they are regulated regimes it's an industry that is highly regulated but the impact varies according to the use of tax haven to do profit shifting and on the other hand we have built significant resolution frameworks at least in Europe after the debt crisis to deal with any kind of problems that banks would face so the frameworks are significantly reinforced so as not to worry as much if some can happen to one particular bank. Thank you, Pranus. I'm going to finish by asking to the panel for a final observation but before doing that Chris do you mind if I bring you into the conversation and having listened to the discussion and the perspectives you know what's your reaction particularly you know particularly in terms of the voice that's needed from Asia as we move forward into 2023 you know with the implementation process. I mean I think it strikes me that you know we still aren't hearing the voice the true voice from Asia. Today we've had representations from players stakeholders in Europe in Africa in you know based in London looking at global operations. ViBuff also deals not just with Asia but but also has responsibilities across the region and I think you know given what we've discussed not just in this panel discussion but but also in the previous sessions from you know keynote speech by Dr. J. Rosengard to the three paper presentations. It's clear to me that I think a lot more work a lot more research that Panna has talked about is needed about the effects of implementing various tax laws changes you know even implementing a 2DMTT right exactly how much each country would raise or not raise is still up in question right so I think a lot more work needs to be done and that there still seems to be a bit of a gap in terms of capacity region wide in terms of being able to address this. We heard you know similar things happening in Africa I think we still are not at the appropriate levels to be able to do this in the region so you know it sounds like if I'm closing the seminar but I would say that is where you know I take away from today's session that there is a lot more work to be done country by country company by company. Thanks Chris and just to close a final observation from each and the panelists and perhaps also you know your own sort of viewers to where further work is needed particularly in terms of implementation in Asia or in the case of turbo Africa. So I'll go left to right on my screen so Sam you're first off. Maybe I'll use my closing comment to comment on the previous point that was made so my point wasn't really where the global minimum tax will raise money from banks. My point was whether that could be addressed within the existing tax system which it can be because it could be addressed by the domestic CFC rules of the countries where those tax ahead those banks are headquartered because they are all headquartered in Europe to your point you don't need global minimum tax to do that you do need global minimum tax to stop people inverting out of Europe so maybe just to clarify my point Michael and then I won't use more airtime in giving us some recombination. Okay right if I buff. Final observation. Yeah I'll just echo the points that Sam has made and for physics Chris has made yeah a lot to come and a lot more challenges so look forward to and and having more right hair on me as well. We'll check back within you next. Check back within you with you next. Your final observations. Final comments. I just want to say that I enjoyed the discussion a lot because usually in the panels we get to discuss with other policymakers, other researchers but we rarely find the opportunity to get a panel so diverse both regionally but also in the industries or institutions that we represent. It's just very interesting to see where we go forward which is out of our hands we try to influence the process all of us and talk to do analysis and see what we can do how we can improve the different estimates or how the rules have lied to you in the industry so it's just very interesting to see in the next few months and years how these turn out to be. Thank you panel. Thank you. I joined the other comments. I have two points one is about exactly about this so this is what we need. We need to really put together the different stakeholders and I totally agree with my audience probably we come from not so different angle and it's not so common and so obvious for us to have a real open discussion for example with business. This is something we really need. The second point is I think that sometimes when we use this discussion I felt that doubts about implementation, it is going to happen you know is what prevent us to have to intensify this process of and that should not be the case I think because in one way or another this is here to stay so you know at least on the fundamentals we can have a discussion without feeling the risk of you know say wasting our time in some sense and good. I want really to push you to when we have having this discussion to focus on investment as much as on revenues. Revenues and investments are two sides of the same coin in this in this story and and this is for developing countries very often investment are almost more important. The way they perceive it and this is my conclusion. Thank you Bruno and last but certainly not least tabo your final observation. Yeah thank you very much and I should just start by saying thank you for having me and for the exciting conversation. It's good to know that only not only African countries have these challenges and that everybody has since they have the same challenges but also I think that just touching on some's point that you know there might be benefits to this global minimum tax and many other things like for example I would tell you that a lot of a number of African countries like Nigeria had a minimum tax that has been repealed or has been repealed because of the complexity and that it discourages FDI because nobody knows exactly how it works and how it works differently from the others. Global might work because everybody would kind of like understand exactly how it the general rules work so it might be positive about that but I'm really really happy about the diversity of views about this and that we should keep these conversations going because we learn a lot from each other across the regions and industries. Thank you very much. And my final comment is to thank the panel for allowing me to to moderate the discussion and being able to hear such a diverse range of views and for me it was a very very interesting discussion so thank you so much for your time and Chris with that I turn back to you. Yep so again I think you know we've heard a lot of views you know that the diversity is I guess you know very much a part of what we hopefully wanted to to design of today's sessions. I hope everybody has had a good census to you know kind of the challenges out there what needs to happen over the course of the next few years on this particular point. The Asia Voices Working Group was set up earlier this year or actually last year to do this exactly to do exactly this together a lot of views and to ultimately build this capacity to deal with this issue of you know tax equity where governance of tax becomes a front and center for everybody not just specific jurisdictions to lead but for you know how we think about where tax is being paid around the world. We have heard that you know there has been a death of voices from the region. The Asia Voices Working Group is designed hopefully to you know help in that process so you know we very welcome any contributions to join the Working Group or just to collaborate with the Working Group to you know develop the discussions the develop the thoughts and insights further. With that end we are targeting another seminar like this one it like it is likely to move to a hybrid model in June 2023 where we will come back and invite you all to contribute further insights not just into pillar two but to the whole BEPS initiative.
